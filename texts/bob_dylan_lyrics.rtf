I crossed the green mountain, I slept by the stream \
Heaven blazin\'92 in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream \
Something came up out of the sea\
Swept through the land of the rich and the free\
\
I look into the eyes of my merciful friend\
And then I ask myself, is this the end? \
Memories linger, sad yet sweet\
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet\
\
Altars are burning with flames falling wide\
The foe has crossed over from the other side\
They tip their caps from the top of the hill\
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill\
\
Along the dim Atlantic line\
The ravaged land lies for miles behind\
The light\'92s comin\'92 forward and the streets are broad \
All must yield to the avenging God\
\
The world is old, the world is gray\
Lessons of life can\'92t be learned in a day\
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand\
To the music that comes from a far better land\
\
Close the eyes of our Captain, peace may he know \
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low \
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend\
Killed outright he was by his own men\
\
It\'92s the last day\'92s last hour of the last happy year \
I feel that the unknown world is so near\
Pride will vanish and glory will rot\
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot\
\
The bells of evening have rung\
There\'92s blasphemy on every tongue\
Let them say that I walked in fair nature\'92s light \
And that I was loyal to truth and to right\
\
Serve God and be cheerful, look upward beyond\
Beyond the darkness that masks the surprises of dawn\
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood\
They never dreamed of surrendering. They fell where they stood\
\
Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star\
You\'92re walkin\'92 in dreams whoever you are \
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost\
The ground\'92s froze hard and the morning is lost\
\
A letter to mother came today\
Gunshot wound to the breast is what it did say \
But he\'92ll be better soon he\'92s in a hospital bed \
But he\'92ll never be better, he\'92s already dead\
\
I\'92m ten miles outside the city and I\'92m lifted away\
In an ancient light that is not of day\
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew \'92em all too well \
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell\
\
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body\'92s tense\
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence\
I\'92ve been hit too hard, I\'92ve seen too much\
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch\
I don\'92t know what I\'92m gonna do\
I was all right \'92til I fell in love with you\
\
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky\
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by\
Now I feel like I\'92m coming to the end of my way\
But I know God is my shield and he won\'92t lead me astray\
Still I don\'92t know what I\'92m gonna do\
I was all right \'92til I fell in love with you\
\
Boys in the street beginning to play\
Girls like birds flying away\
When I\'92m gone you will remember my name\
I\'92m gonna win my way to wealth and fame\
I don\'92t know what I\'92m gonna do\
I was all right \'92til I fell in love with you\
\
Junk is piling up, taking up space\
My eyes feel like they\'92re falling off my face\
Sweat falling down, I\'92m staring at the floor\
I\'92m thinking about that girl who won\'92t be back no more\
I don\'92t know what I\'92m gonna do\
I was all right \'92til I fell in love with you\
\
Well, I\'92m tired of talking, I\'92m tired of trying to explain\
My attempts to please you were all in vain\
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down\
If I\'92m still among the living, I\'92ll be Dixie bound\
I just don\'92t know what I\'92m gonna do\
I was all right \'92til I fell in love with you\
\
Ten thousand men on a hill\
Ten thousand men on a hill\
Some of \'92m goin\'92 down, some of \'92m gonna get killed\
\
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue\
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue\
Drummin\'92 in the morning, in the evening they\'92ll be coming for you\
\
Ten thousand men on the move\
Ten thousand men on the move\
None of them doing nothin\'92 that your mama wouldn\'92t disapprove\
\
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold\
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold\
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold\
\
Hey! Who could your lover be?\
Hey! Who could your lover be?\
Let me eat off his head so you can really see!\
\
Ten thousand women all dressed in white\
Ten thousand women all dressed in white\
Standin\'92 at my window wishing me goodnight\
\
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail\
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail\
Each one of \'92m got seven wives, each one of \'92m just out of jail\
\
Ten thousand women all sweepin\'92 my room\
Ten thousand women all sweepin\'92 my room\
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom\
\
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!\
Baby, thank you for my tea!\
It\'92s so sweet of you to be so nice to me										
\fs24 \cb1 \

\fs32 \cb3 One by one, they followed the sun\
One by one, until there were none\
Two by two, to their lovers they flew\
Two by two, into the foggy dew\
Three by three, they danced on the sea\
Four by four, they danced on the shore\
Five by five, they tried to survive\
Six by six, they were playing with tricks\
\
How many paths did they try and fail?\
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?\
How much poison did they inhale?\
How many black cats crossed their trail?\
\
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven\
Eight by eight, they got to the gate\
Nine by nine, they drank the wine\
Ten by ten, they drank it again\
\
How many tomorrows have they given away?\
How many compared to yesterday?\
How many more without any reward?\
How many more can they afford?\
\
Two by two, they stepped into the ark\
Two by two, they step in the dark\
Three by three, they\'92re turning the key\
Four by four, they turn it some more\
\
One by one, they follow the sun\
Two by two, to another rendezvous\
\
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?\
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?\
I\'92ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains\
I\'92ve walked and I\'92ve crawled on six crooked highways\
I\'92ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests\
I\'92ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans\
I\'92ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard\
And it\'92s a hard, and it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard, and it\'92s a hard\
And it\'92s a hard rain\'92s a-gonna fall\
\
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?\
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?\
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it\
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it\
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin\'92\
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin\'92\
I saw a white ladder all covered with water\
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken\
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children\
And it\'92s a hard, and it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard\
And it\'92s a hard rain\'92s a-gonna fall\
\
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?\
And what did you hear, my darling young one?\
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin\'92\
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world\
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin\'92\
Heard ten thousand whisperin\'92 and nobody listenin\'92\
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin\'92\
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter\
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley\
And it\'92s a hard, and it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard\
And it\'92s a hard rain\'92s a-gonna fall\
\
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?\
Who did you meet, my darling young one?\
I met a young child beside a dead pony\
I met a white man who walked a black dog\
I met a young woman whose body was burning\
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow\
I met one man who was wounded in love\
I met another man who was wounded with hatred\
And it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard\
It\'92s a hard rain\'92s a-gonna fall\
\
Oh, what\'92ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?\
Oh, what\'92ll you do now, my darling young one?\
I\'92m a-goin\'92 back out \'92fore the rain starts a-fallin\'92\
I\'92ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest\
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty\
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters\
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison\
Where the executioner\'92s face is always well hidden\
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten\
Where black is the color, where none is the number\
And I\'92ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it\
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it\
Then I\'92ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin\'92\
But I\'92ll know my song well before I start singin\'92\
And it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard, it\'92s a hard\
It\'92s a hard rain\'92s a-gonna fall

\fs32 \cb3 How many times have you heard someone say\
If I had his money I'd do things my way\
Hmm, but little they know\
Hmm, it's so hard to find\
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.\
\
Hmm, once I was wadding in fortune and fame\
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game\
But suddenly it happened\
Hmm, I lost every dime\
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.\
\
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out\
My friends and my love ones\
I'll leave there ain't no doubt\
But one thing for certain\
When it comes my time\
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.										
\fs24 \cb1 \

\fs32 \cb3 I can hear the turning of the key\
I\'92ve been deceived by the clown inside of me\
I thought that he was righteous but he\'92s vain\
Oh, something\'92s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain\
\
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost\
He\'92s always off somewhere when I need him most\
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill\
But my heart is a-tellin\'92 me I love ya still\
\
I come back to the town from the flaming moon\
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon\
I love to see you dress before the mirror\
Won\'92t you let me in your room one time \'92fore I finally disappear?\
\
Everybody\'92s wearing a disguise\
To hide what they\'92ve got left behind their eyes\
But me, I can\'92t cover what I am\
Wherever the children go I\'92ll follow them\
\
I march in the parade of liberty\
But as long as I love you I\'92m not free\
How long must I suffer such abuse\
Won\'92t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?\
\
I\'92ve given up the game, I\'92ve got to leave\
The pot of gold is only make-believe\
The treasure can\'92t be found by men who search\
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church\
\
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed\
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list\
My head tells me it\'92s time to make a change\
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you\'92re strange\
\
One more time at midnight, near the wall\
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl\
Won\'92t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?\
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it\
\
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can\'92t jump it\
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see\
I\'92m just sitting here beating on my trumpet\
With all these promises you left for me\
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\
\
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick\
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me\
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic\
When you knew I had some other place to be\
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\
\
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously\
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately\
\
Well, six white horses that you did promise\
Were fin\'92lly delivered down to the penitentiary\
But to live outside the law, you must be honest\
I know you always say that you agree\
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\
\
Well, I don\'92t know how it happened\
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate\
But ev\'92rybody else, even yourself\
They\'92re just gonna have to wait\
\
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets\
The Persian drunkard, he follows me\
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can\'92t unlock it\
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key\
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\
\
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed\
That a man can\'92t give his address out to bad company\
And now I stand here lookin\'92 at your yellow railroad\
In the ruins of your balcony\
Wond\'92ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie\
\
Well, I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
And ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
Come on brothers, join the band\
Come on sisters, clap your hands\
Tell everybody that\'92s in the land\
You ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
Well, I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
And ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
Brown and blue and white and black\
All one color on the one-way track\
We got this far and ain\'92t a-goin\'92 back\
And I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
Well, I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
We\'92re gonna notify your next of kin\
You\'92re gonna raise the roof until the house falls in\
If you get knocked down get up again\
We ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
Well, I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
We\'92ll sing this song all night long\
Sing it to my baby from midnight on\
She\'92ll sing it to you when I\'92m dead and gone\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
Well, I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
Ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more, no more\
I ain\'92t a-gonna grieve no more\
\
When a man he serves the Lord, it makes his life worthwhile\
It don\'92t matter \'92bout his position, it don\'92t matter \'92bout his lifestyle\
Talk about perfection, I ain\'92t never seen none\
And there ain\'92t no man righteous, no not one\
\
Sometimes the devil likes to drive you from the neighborhood\
He\'92ll even work his ways through those whose intentions are good\
Some like to worship on the moon, others are worshipping the sun\
And there ain\'92t no man righteous, no not one\
\
Look around, ya see so many social hypocrites\
Like to make rules for others while they do just the opposite\
\
You can\'92t get to glory by the raising and the lowering of no flag\
Put your goodness next to God\'92s and it comes out like a filthy rag\
In a city of darkness there\'92s no need of the sun\
And there ain\'92t no man righteous, no not one\
\
Done so many evil things in the name of love, it\'92s a crying shame\
I never did see no fire that could put out a flame\
\
Pull your hat down, baby, pull the wool down over your eyes\
Keep a-talking, baby, \'92til you run right out of alibis\
Someday you\'92ll account for all the deeds that you done\
Well, there ain\'92t no man righteous, no not one\
\
God got the power, man has got his vanity\
Man gotta choose before God can set him free\
Don\'92t you know there\'92s nothing new that\'92s under the sun?\
Well, there ain\'92t no man righteous, no not one\
\
When I\'92m gone don\'92t wonder where I be\
Just say that I trusted in God and that Christ was in me\
Say He defeated the devil, He was God\'92s chosen Son\
And that there ain\'92t no man righteous, no not one\cb1 \

\cb3 Ain't no more cane on the brazos\
Oh, oh, oh, oh...\
Its all been ground down to molasses\
Oh, oh- oh, oh- oh...\
\
You shoulda been on the river in 1910\
They were driving the women just like they drove the men.\
\
Go down old hannah, don'cha rise no more\
Don't you rise up til judgment day's for sure\
\
Ain't no more cane on the brazos\
Its all been ground down to molasses\
\
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old shine\
Well ya drove that bully til he went stone blind\
\
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head\
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead\
\
Ain't no more cane on the brazos\
Its all been ground down to molasses.\
\
As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden\
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vines \
I was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain \
Someone hit me from behind\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
Through this weary world of woe \
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92\
No one on earth would ever know\
\
They say prayer has the power to help\
So pray for me mother\
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell\
I\'92m trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others \
But oh, mother, things ain\'92t going well\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
I\'92ll burn that bridge before you can cross \
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92\
They\'92ll be no mercy for you once you\'92ve lost\
\
Now I\'92m all worn down by weepin\'92\
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry\
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin\'92\
I\'92ll just slaughter them where they lie\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
Through a world mysterious and vague \
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92\
Walking through the cities of the plague\
\
The whole world is filled with speculation\
The whole wide world which people say is round \
They will tear your mind away from contemplation \
They will jump on your misfortune when you\'92re down\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
Eatin\'92 hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town \
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92\
Someday you\'92ll be glad to have me around\
\
They will crush you with wealth and power \
Every waking moment you could crack\
I\'92ll make the most of one last extra hour\
I\'92ll avenge my father\'92s death then I\'92ll step back\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
Hand me down my walkin\'92 cane\
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92\
Got to get you out of my miserable brain\
\
It\'92s bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying \
Fame and honor never seem to fade\
The fire\'92s gone out but the light is never dying \
Who says I can\'92t get heavenly aid?\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
Carrying a dead man\'92s shield\
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92\
Walkin\'92 with a toothache in my heel\
\
The suffering is unending\
Every nook and cranny has its tears \
I\'92m not playing, I\'92m not pretending \
I\'92m not nursing any superfluous fears\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
Walkin\'92 ever since the other night \
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92 \
Walkin\'92 \'92til I\'92m clean out of sight\
\
As I walked out in the mystic garden\
On a hot summer day, hot summer lawn \
Excuse me, ma\'92am, I beg your pardon \
There\'92s no one here, the gardener is gone\
\
Ain\'92t talkin\'92, just walkin\'92\
Up the road around the bend\
Heart burnin\'92, still yearnin\'92\
In the last outback, at the world\'92s end

I\'92d even dance a jig on the ground\
Well, everybody gets their hour\

Little David when he picked up his pebbles\
Even Sampson after he went blind\
Well, everybody gets the chance\

When my time arrives you better run for your life\

I\'92m just restin\'92 at your gate so that I won\'92t be late\
And, momma, I\'92m a-just sittin\'92 on the shelf\
Look out your window fair and you\'92ll see me squattin\'92 there\
Just a-fumblin\'92 and a-mumblin\'92 to myself\
Well, after my cigarette\'92s been smoked up\
After all my liquor\'92s been drunk\
After my dreams are dreamed out\
After all my thoughts have been thunk\
Well, after I do some of these things\
I\'92m gonna do what I have to do\
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide\
\'92Cause babe, I\'92ll do it all over you\
\
All the tired horses in the sun\
How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done? Hmm.\
\
You walk into the room\
With your pencil in your hand\
You see somebody naked\
And you say, \'93Who is that man?\'94\
You try so hard\
But you don\'92t understand\
Just what you\'92ll say\
When you get home\
\
Because something is happening here\
But you don\'92t know what it is\
Do you, Mister Jones?\
\
You raise up your head\
And you ask, \'93Is this where it is?\'94\
And somebody points to you and says\
\'93It\'92s his\'94\
And you say, \'93What\'92s mine?\'94\
And somebody else says, \'93Where what is?\'94\
And you say, \'93Oh my God\
Am I here all alone?\'94\
\
Because something is happening here\
But you don\'92t know what it is\
Do you, Mister Jones?\
\
You hand in your ticket\
And you go watch the geek\
Who immediately walks up to you\
When he hears you speak\
And says, \'93How does it feel\
To be such a freak?\'94\
And you say, \'93Impossible\'94\
As he hands you a bone\
\
Because something is happening here\
But you don\'92t know what it is\
Do you, Mister Jones?\
\
You have many contacts\
Among the lumberjacks\
To get you facts\
When someone attacks your imagination\
But nobody has any respect\
Anyway they already expect you\
To just give a check\
To tax-deductible charity organizations\
\
You\'92ve been with the professors\
And they\'92ve all liked your looks\
With great lawyers you have\
Discussed lepers and crooks\
You\'92ve been through all of\
F. Scott Fitzgerald\'92s books\
You\'92re very well read\
It\'92s well known\
\
Because something is happening here\
But you don\'92t know what it is\
Do you, Mister Jones?\
\
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you\
And then he kneels\
He crosses himself\
And then he clicks his high heels\
And without further notice\
He asks you how it feels\
And he says, \'93Here is your throat back\
Thanks for the loan\'94\
\
Because something is happening here\
But you don\'92t know what it is\
Do you, Mister Jones?\
\
Now you see this one-eyed midget\
Shouting the word \'93NOW\'94\
And you say, \'93For what reason?\'94\
And he says, \'93How?\'94\
And you say, \'93What does this mean?\'94\
And he screams back, \'93You\'92re a cow\
Give me some milk\
Or else go home\'94\
\
Because something is happening here\
But you don\'92t know what it is\
Do you, Mister Jones?\
\
Well, you walk into the room\
Like a camel and then you frown\
You put your eyes in your pocket\
And your nose on the ground\
There ought to be a law\
Against you comin\'92 around\
You should be made\
To wear earphones\
\
Because something is happening here\
But you don\'92t know what it is\
Do you, Mister Jones?\
\
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind\
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine\
Never bein\'92 able to separate the good from the bad\
Ooh, I can\'92t stand it, I can\'92t stand it\
It\'92s makin\'92 me feel so sad\
\
Dead man, dead man\
When will you arise?\
Cobwebs in your mind\
Dust upon your eyes\
\
Satan got you by the heel, there\'92s a bird\'92s nest in your hair\
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?\
The way that you hold your head, cursin\'92 God with every move\
Ooh, I can\'92t stand it, I can\'92t stand it\
What are you tryin\'92 to prove?\
\
Dead man, dead man\
When will you arise?\
Cobwebs in your mind\
Dust upon your eyes\
\
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin\
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in\
The race of the engine that overrules your heart\
Ooh, I can\'92t stand it, I can\'92t stand it\
Pretending that you\'92re so smart\
\
Dead man, dead man\
When will you arise?\
Cobwebs in your mind\
Dust upon your eyes\
\
What are you tryin\'92 to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?\
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?\
The tuxedo that you\'92re wearin\'92, the flower in your lapel\
Ooh, I can\'92t stand it, I can\'92t stand it\
You wanna take me down to hell\
\
Dead man, dead man\
When will you arise?\
Cobwebs in your mind\
Dust upon your eyes\
\
Hollis Brown\
He lived on the outside of town\
Hollis Brown\
He lived on the outside of town\
With his wife and five children\
And his cabin fallin\'92 down\
\
You looked for work and money\
And you walked a rugged mile\
You looked for work and money\
And you walked a rugged mile\
Your children are so hungry\
That they don\'92t know how to smile\
\
Your baby\'92s eyes look crazy\
They\'92re a-tuggin\'92 at your sleeve\
Your baby\'92s eyes look crazy\
They\'92re a-tuggin\'92 at your sleeve\
You walk the floor and wonder why\
With every breath you breathe\
\
The rats have got your flour\
Bad blood it got your mare\
The rats have got your flour\
Bad blood it got your mare\
If there\'92s anyone that knows\
Is there anyone that cares?\
\
You prayed to the Lord above\
Oh please send you a friend\
You prayed to the Lord above\
Oh please send you a friend\
Your empty pockets tell yuh\
That you ain\'92t a-got no friend\
\
Your babies are crying louder\
It\'92s pounding on your brain\
Your babies are crying louder now\
It\'92s pounding on your brain\
Your wife\'92s screams are stabbin\'92 you\
Like the dirty drivin\'92 rain\
\
Your grass it is turning black\
There\'92s no water in your well\
Your grass is turning black\
There\'92s no water in your well\
You spent your last lone dollar\
On seven shotgun shells\
\
Way out in the wilderness\
A cold coyote calls\
Way out in the wilderness\
A cold coyote calls\
Your eyes fix on the shotgun\
That\'92s hangin\'92 on the wall\
\
Your brain is a-bleedin\'92\
And your legs can\'92t seem to stand\
Your brain is a-bleedin\'92\
And your legs can\'92t seem to stand\
Your eyes fix on the shotgun\
That you\'92re holdin\'92 in your hand\
\
There\'92s seven breezes a-blowin\'92\
All around the cabin door\
There\'92s seven breezes a-blowin\'92\
All around the cabin door\
Seven shots ring out\
Like the ocean\'92s pounding roar\
\
There\'92s seven people dead\
On a South Dakota farm\
There\'92s seven people dead\
On a South Dakota farm\
Somewhere in the distance\
There\'92s seven new people born\
\
Far between sundown\'92s finish an\'92 midnight\'92s broken toll\
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing\
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds\
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing\
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight\
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\
An\'92 for each an\'92 ev\'92ry underdog soldier in the night\
An\'92 we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\
\
In the city\'92s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening\
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin\'92 rain\
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning\
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake\
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an\'92 forsaked\
Tolling for the outcast, burnin\'92 constantly at stake\
An\'92 we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\
\
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail\
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder\
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze\
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder\
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind\
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind\
An\'92 the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time\
An\'92 we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\
\
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position\
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts\
All down in taken-for-granted situations\
Tolling for the deaf an\'92 blind, tolling for the mute\
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute\
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an\'92 cheated by pursuit\
An\'92 we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\
\
Even though a cloud\'92s white curtain in a far-off corner flashed\
An\'92 the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting\
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\
An\'92 for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\
An\'92 we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\
\
Starry-eyed an\'92 laughing as I recall when we were caught\
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\
As we listened one last time an\'92 we watched with one last look\
Spellbound an\'92 swallowed \'92til the tolling ended\
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed\
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an\'92 worse\
An\'92 for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\
An\'92 we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\
\
I was riding on the Mayflower\
When I thought I spied some land\
I yelled for Captain Arab\
I have yuh understand\
Who came running to the deck\
Said, \'93Boys, forget the whale\
Look on over yonder\
Cut the engines\
Change the sail\
Haul on the bowline\'94\
We sang that melody\
Like all tough sailors do\
When they are far away at sea\
\
\'93I think I\'92ll call it America\'94\
I said as we hit land\
I took a deep breath\
I fell down, I could not stand\
Captain Arab he started\
Writing up some deeds\
He said, \'93Let\'92s set up a fort\
And start buying the place with beads\'94\
Just then this cop comes down the street\
Crazy as a loon\
He throw us all in jail\
For carryin\'92 harpoons\
\
Ah me I busted out\
Don\'92t even ask me how\
I went to get some help\
I walked by a Guernsey cow\
Who directed me down\
To the Bowery slums\
Where people carried signs around\
Saying, \'93Ban the bums\'94\
I jumped right into line\
Sayin\'92, \'93I hope that I\'92m not late\'94\
When I realized I hadn\'92t eaten\
For five days straight\
\
I went into a restaurant\
Lookin\'92 for the cook\
I told them I was the editor\
Of a famous etiquette book\
The waitress he was handsome\
He wore a powder blue cape\
I ordered some suzette, I said\
\'93Could you please make that crepe\'94\
Just then the whole kitchen exploded\
From boilin\'92 fat\
Food was flying everywhere\
And I left without my hat\
\
Now, I didn\'92t mean to be nosy\
But I went into a bank\
To get some bail for Arab\
And all the boys back in the tank\
They asked me for some collateral\
And I pulled down my pants\
They threw me in the alley\
When up comes this girl from France\
Who invited me to her house\
I went, but she had a friend\
Who knocked me out\
And robbed my boots\
And I was on the street again\
\
Well, I rapped upon a house\
With the U.S. flag upon display\
I said, \'93Could you help me out\
I got some friends down the way\'94\
The man says, \'93Get out of here\
I\'92ll tear you limb from limb\'94\
I said, \'93You know they refused Jesus, too\'94\
He said, \'93You\'92re not Him\
Get out of here before I break your bones\
I ain\'92t your pop\'94\
I decided to have him arrested\
And I went looking for a cop\
\
I ran right outside\
And I hopped inside a cab\
I went out the other door\
This Englishman said, \'93Fab\'94\
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand\
And a chariot that stood\
Parked across from a building\
Advertising brotherhood\
I ran right through the front door\
Like a hobo sailor does\
But it was just a funeral parlor\
And the man asked me who I was\
\
I repeated that my friends\
Were all in jail, with a sigh\
He gave me his card\
He said, \'93Call me if they die\'94\
I shook his hand and said goodbye\
Ran out to the street\
When a bowling ball came down the road\
And knocked me off my feet\
A pay phone was ringing\
It just about blew my mind\
When I picked it up and said hello\
This foot came through the line\
\
Well, by this time I was fed up\
At tryin\'92 to make a stab\
At bringin\'92 back any help\
For my friends and Captain Arab\
I decided to flip a coin\
Like either heads or tails\
Would let me know if I should go\
Back to ship or back to jail\
So I hocked my sailor suit\
And I got a coin to flip\
It came up tails\
It rhymed with sails\
So I made it back to the ship\
\
\
Well, I got back and took\
The parkin\'92 ticket off the mast\
I was ripping it to shreds\
When this coastguard boat went past\
They asked me my name\
And I said, \'93Captain Kidd\'94\
They believed me but\
They wanted to know\
What exactly that I did\
I said for the Pope of Eruke\
I was employed\
They let me go right away\
They were very paranoid\
\
Well, the last I heard of Arab\
He was stuck on a whale\
That was married to the deputy\
Sheriff of the jail\
But the funniest thing was\
When I was leavin\'92 the bay\
I saw three ships a-sailin\'92\
They were all heading my way\
I asked the captain what his name was\
And how come he didn\'92t drive a truck\
He said his name was Columbus\
I just said, \'93Good luck\'94\
\
As I went out one morning\
To breathe the air around Tom Paine\'92s\
I spied the fairest damsel\
That ever did walk in chains\
I offer\'92d her my hand\
She took me by the arm\
I knew that very instant\
She meant to do me harm\
\
\'93Depart from me this moment\'94\
I told her with my voice\
Said she, \'93But I don\'92t wish to\'94\
Said I, \'93But you have no choice\'94\
\'93I beg you, sir,\'94 she pleaded\
From the corners of her mouth\
\'93I will secretly accept you\
And together we\'92ll fly south\'94\
\
Just then Tom Paine, himself\
Came running from across the field\
Shouting at this lovely girl\
And commanding her to yield\
And as she was letting go her grip\
Up Tom Paine did run,\
\'93I\'92m sorry, sir,\'94 he said to me\
\'93I\'92m sorry for what she\'92s done\'94\
\
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night\
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall\
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood\
Cries out, \'93My God, they killed them all!\'94\
Here comes the story of the Hurricane\
The man the authorities came to blame\
For somethin\'92 that he never done\
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\
The champion of the world\
\
Three bodies lyin\'92 there does Patty see\
And another man named Bello, movin\'92 around mysteriously\
\'93I didn\'92t do it,\'94 he says, and he throws up his hands\
\'93I was only robbin\'92 the register, I hope you understand\
I saw them leavin\'92,\'94 he says, and he stops\
\'93One of us had better call up the cops\'94\
And so Patty calls the cops\
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin\'92\
In the hot New Jersey night\
\
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town\
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin\'92 around\
Number one contender for the middleweight crown\
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\
Just like the time before and the time before that\
In Paterson that\'92s just the way things go\
If you\'92re black you might as well not show up on the street\
\'92Less you wanna draw the heat\
\
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops\
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin\'92 around\
He said, \'93I saw two men runnin\'92 out, they looked like middleweights\
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates\'94\
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\
Cop said, \'93Wait a minute, boys, this one\'92s not dead\'94\
So they took him to the infirmary\
And though this man could hardly see\
They told him that he could identify the guilty men\
\
Four in the mornin\'92 and they haul Rubin in\
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs\
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin\'92 eye\
Says, \'93Wha\'92d you bring him in here for? He ain\'92t the guy!\'94\
Yes, here\'92s the story of the Hurricane\
The man the authorities came to blame\
For somethin\'92 that he never done\
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\
The champion of the world\
\
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame\
Rubin\'92s in South America, fightin\'92 for his name\
While Arthur Dexter Bradley\'92s still in the robbery game\
And the cops are puttin\'92 the screws to him, lookin\'92 for somebody to blame\
\'93Remember that murder that happened in a bar?\'94\
\'93Remember you said you saw the getaway car?\'94\
\'93You think you\'92d like to play ball with the law?\'94\
\'93Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin\'92 that night?\'94\
\'93Don\'92t forget that you are white\'94\
\
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, \'93I\'92m really not sure\'94\
Cops said, \'93A poor boy like you could use a break\
We got you for the motel job and we\'92re talkin\'92 to your friend Bello\
Now you don\'92t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\
You\'92ll be doin\'92 society a favor\
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin\'92 braver\
We want to put his ass in stir\
We want to pin this triple murder on him\
He ain\'92t no Gentleman Jim\'94\
\
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch\
But he never did like to talk about it all that much\
It\'92s my work, he\'92d say, and I do it for pay\
And when it\'92s over I\'92d just as soon go on my way\
Up to some paradise\
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice\
And ride a horse along a trail\
But then they took him to the jailhouse\
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse\
\
All of Rubin\'92s cards were marked in advance\
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\
The judge made Rubin\'92s witnesses drunkards from the slums\
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger\
And though they could not produce the gun\
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\
And the all-white jury agreed\
\
Rubin Carter was falsely tried\
The crime was murder \'93one,\'94 guess who testified?\
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\
How can the life of such a man\
Be in the palm of some fool\'92s hand?\
To see him obviously framed\
Couldn\'92t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land\
Where justice is a game\
\
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties\
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\
An innocent man in a living hell\
That\'92s the story of the Hurricane\
But it won\'92t be over till they clear his name\
And give him back the time he\'92s done\
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\
The champion of the world\
\
Oh God said to Abraham, \'93Kill me a son\'94\
Abe says, \'93Man, you must be puttin\'92 me on\'94\
God say, \'93No.\'94 Abe say, \'93What?\'94\
God say, \'93You can do what you want Abe, but\
The next time you see me comin\'92 you better run\'94\
Well Abe says, \'93Where do you want this killin\'92 done?\'94\
God says, \'93Out on Highway 61\'94\
\
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose\
Welfare Department they wouldn\'92t give him no clothes\
He asked poor Howard where can I go\
Howard said there\'92s only one place I know\
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run\
Ol\'92 Howard just pointed with his gun\
And said that way down on Highway 61\
\
Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King\
I got forty red white and blue shoestrings\
And a thousand telephones that don\'92t ring\
Do you know where I can get rid of these things\
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son\
And he said yes I think it can be easily done\
Just take everything down to Highway 61\
\
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night\
Told the first father that things weren\'92t right\
My complexion she said is much too white\
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you\'92re right\
Let me tell the second mother this has been done\
But the second mother was with the seventh son\
And they were both out on Highway 61\
\
Now the rovin\'92 gambler he was very bored\
He was tryin\'92 to create a next world war\
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor\
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before\
But yes I think it can be very easily done\
We\'92ll just put some bleachers out in the sun\
And have it on Highway 61

\

\fs32 \cb3 I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze\
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn\
I courted her proudly but now she is gone\
Gone as the season she\'92s taken\
\
Through young summer\'92s breeze, I stole her away\
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay\
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day\
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us\
\
Of the two sisters, I loved the young\
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one\
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone\
By the jealousy of others around her\
\
For her parasite sister, I had no respect\
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect\
Countless visions of the other she\'92d reflect\
As a crutch for her scenes and her society\
\
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused\
The changes I was going through can\'92t even be used\
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose\
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime\
\
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip\
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped\
Noticing not that I\'92d already slipped\
To a sin of love\'92s false security\
\
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace\
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies\
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, \'93Please\
What\'92s wrong and what\'92s exactly the matter?\'94\
\
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen\
The timeless explosion of fantasy\'92s dream\
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen\
Tumbled all down into pieces\
\
\'93The tragic figure!\'94 her sister did shout\
\'93Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!\'94\
And I in my armor, turning about\
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness\
\
Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound\
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground\
And she in between, the victim of sound\
Soon shattered as a child \'92neath her shadows\
\
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight\
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight\
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night\
Leaving all of love\'92s ashes behind me\
\
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet\
The words to say I\'92m sorry, I haven\'92t found yet\
I think of her often and hope whoever she\'92s met\
Will be fully aware of how precious she is\
\
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me\
\'93How good, how good does it feel to be free?\'94\
And I answer them most mysteriously\
\'93Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?\'94\
\
I pity the poor immigrant\
Who wishes he would\'92ve stayed home\
Who uses all his power to do evil\
But in the end is always left so alone\
That man whom with his fingers cheats\
And who lies with ev\'92ry breath\
Who passionately hates his life\
And likewise, fears his death\
\
I pity the poor immigrant\
Whose strength is spent in vain\
Whose heaven is like Ironsides\
Whose tears are like rain\
Who eats but is not satisfied\
Who hears but does not see\
Who falls in love with wealth itself\
And turns his back on me\
\
I pity the poor immigrant\
Who tramples through the mud\
Who fills his mouth with laughing\
And who builds his town with blood\
Whose visions in the final end\
Must shatter like the glass\
I pity the poor immigrant\
When his gladness comes to pass

\
Someone\'92s got it in for me, they\'92re planting stories in the press\
Whoever it is I wish they\'92d cut it out but when they will I can only guess\
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy\
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me\
I can\'92t help it if I\'92m lucky\
\
People see me all the time and they just can\'92t remember how to act\
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts\
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at\
I couldn\'92t believe after all these years, you didn\'92t know me better than that\
Sweet lady\
\
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth\
Blowing down the backroads headin\'92 south\
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\
You\'92re an idiot, babe\
It\'92s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\
\
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike\
I haven\'92t known peace and quiet for so long I can\'92t remember what it\'92s like\
There\'92s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin\'92 out of a boxcar door\
You didn\'92t know it, you didn\'92t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars\
After losin\'92 every battle\
\
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin\'92 \'92bout the way things sometimes are\
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin\'92 me see stars\
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies\
One day you\'92ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin\'92 around your eyes\
Blood on your saddle\
\
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb\
Blowing through the curtains in your room\
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\
You\'92re an idiot, babe\
It\'92s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\
\
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart\
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn\'92t enough to change my heart\
Now everything\'92s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped\
What\'92s good is bad, what\'92s bad is good, you\'92ll find out when you reach the top\
You\'92re on the bottom\
\
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind\
I can\'92t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0don\'92t look into mine\
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0building burned\
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0springtime turned\
Slowly into Autumn\
\
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull\
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol\
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\
You\'92re an idiot, babe\
It\'92s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\
\
I can\'92t feel you anymore, I can\'92t even touch the books you\'92ve read\
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin\'92 I was somebody else instead\
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy\
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory\
And all your ragin\'92 glory\
\
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I\'92m finally free\
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me\
You\'92ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above\
And I\'92ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love\
And it makes me feel so sorry\
\
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats\
Blowing through the letters that we wrote\
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves\
We\'92re idiots, babe\
It\'92s a wonder we can even feed ourselves\
\
When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb\
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb\
When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace\
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race\
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up\
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup\
If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on\
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it\
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long\
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong\
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day\
And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away\
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'\
And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'\
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'\
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'\
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'\
And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'\
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm\
And to yourself you sometimes say\
"I never knew it was gonna be this way\
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born"\
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat\
And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet\
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\
And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare\
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying\
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'\
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\
And you need it badly but it lays on the street\
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat\
And you think yer ears might a been hurt\
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt\
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush\
When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush\
And all the time you were holdin' three queens\
And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean\
Like in the middle of Life magazine\
Bouncin' around a pinball machine\
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying\
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'\
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\
And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed\
And no matter how you try you just can't say it\
And yer scared to yer soul  you just might forget it\
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\
And his jaws start closin with you underneath\
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign\
And you say to yourself just what am I doin'\
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'\
On this curve I'm hanging\
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking\
In this air I'm inhaling\
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\
Why am I walking, where am I running\
What am  I saying, what am I knowing\
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'\
On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'\
In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'\
In the words that I'm thinkin'\
In this ocean of hours I'm  all the time drinkin'\
Who am I helping, what am I breaking\
What am I giving, what am I taking\
But you try with your whole soul best\
Never to think these thoughts and never to let\
Them kind of thoughts gain ground\
Or make yer heart pound\
But then again you know why they're around\
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\
"Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping\
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'\
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking\
If that was you in the dream that was screaming\
And you know that it's something special you're needin'\
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'\
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding\
And you need something special\
Yeah, you need something special all right\
You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track\
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back\
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler\
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever\
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over\
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race\
That won't laugh at yer looks\
Your voice or your face\
And by any number of bets in the book\
Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze\
You need something to open up a new door\
To show you something you seen before\
But overlooked a hundred times or more\
You need something to open your eyes\
You need something to make it known\
That it's you and no one else that owns\
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting\
That the world ain't got you beat\
That it ain't got you licked\
It can't get you crazy no matter how many\
Times you might get kicked\
You need something special all right\
You need something special to give you hope\
But hope's just a word\
That maybe you said or maybe you heard\
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve\
\
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad\
And yer trouble is you know it too good\
"Cause you look an' you start getting the chills\
\
"Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill\
And it ain't on Macy's window sill\
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map\
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house\
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ\
And it ain't on that dimlit stage\
With that half-wit comedian on it\
Ranting and raving and taking yer money\
And you thinks it's funny\
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club\
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club\
And sure as hell you're bound to tell\
That no matter how hard you rub\
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub\
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you\
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you\
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house\
Or down any movie star's blouse\
And you can't find it on the golf course\
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus\
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes\
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons\
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices\
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'\
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin\
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow\
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry\
When you can't even sense if they got any insides\
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows\
No you'll not now or no other day\
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache\'a5\
And inside it the people made of molasses\
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses\
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies\
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny\
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack\
And before you can count from one to ten\
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back\
My friend\
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl\
And play games with each other in their sand-box world\
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools\
That run around gallant\
And make all rules for the ones that got talent\
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do\
And think they're foolin' you\
The ones who jump on the wagon\
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style\
To get their kicks, get out of it quick\
And make all kinds of money and chicks\
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat\
Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that\
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at\
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel\
Good God Almighty\
			THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL"\
\
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race\
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face\
You gotta look some other place\
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'\
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'\
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'\
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'\
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there\
And out there somewhere\
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads\
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows\
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways\
You can touch and twist\
And turn two kinds of doorknobs\
You can either go to the church of your choice\
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital\
You'll find God in the church of your choice\
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital\
\
And though it's only my opinion\
I may be right or wrong\
You'll find them both\
In the Grand Canyon\
At sundown\
\
They\'92re selling postcards of the hanging\
They\'92re painting the passports brown\
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors\
The circus is in town\
Here comes the blind commissioner\
They\'92ve got him in a trance\
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker\
The other is in his pants\
And the riot squad they\'92re restless\
They need somewhere to go\
As Lady and I look out tonight\
From Desolation Row\
\
Cinderella, she seems so easy\
\'93It takes one to know one,\'94 she smiles\
And puts her hands in her back pockets\
Bette Davis style\
And in comes Romeo, he\'92s moaning\
\'93You Belong to Me I Believe\'94\
And someone says, \'93You\'92re in the wrong place my friend\
You better leave\'94\
And the only sound that\'92s left\
After the ambulances go\
Is Cinderella sweeping up\
On Desolation Row\
\
Now the moon is almost hidden\
The stars are beginning to hide\
The fortune-telling lady\
Has even taken all her things inside\
All except for Cain and Abel\
And the hunchback of Notre Dame\
Everybody is making love\
Or else expecting rain\
And the Good Samaritan, he\'92s dressing\
He\'92s getting ready for the show\
He\'92s going to the carnival tonight\
On Desolation Row\
\
Now Ophelia, she\'92s \'92neath the window\
For her I feel so afraid\
On her twenty-second birthday\
She already is an old maid\
To her, death is quite romantic\
She wears an iron vest\
Her profession\'92s her religion\
Her sin is her lifelessness\
And though her eyes are fixed upon\
Noah\'92s great rainbow\
She spends her time peeking\
Into Desolation Row\
\
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood\
With his memories in a trunk\
Passed this way an hour ago\
With his friend, a jealous monk\
He looked so immaculately frightful\
As he bummed a cigarette\
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes\
And reciting the alphabet\
Now you would not think to look at him\
But he was famous long ago\
For playing the electric violin\
On Desolation Row\
\
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world\
Inside of a leather cup\
But all his sexless patients\
They\'92re trying to blow it up\
Now his nurse, some local loser\
She\'92s in charge of the cyanide hole\
And she also keeps the cards that read\
\'93Have Mercy on His Soul\'94\
They all play on pennywhistles\
You can hear them blow\
If you lean your head out far enough\
From Desolation Row\
\
Across the street they\'92ve nailed the curtains\
They\'92re getting ready for the feast\
The Phantom of the Opera\
A perfect image of a priest\
They\'92re spoonfeeding Casanova\
To get him to feel more assured\
Then they\'92ll kill him with self-confidence\
After poisoning him with words\
And the Phantom\'92s shouting to skinny girls\
\'93Get Outa Here If You Don\'92t Know\
Casanova is just being punished for going\
To Desolation Row\'94\
\
Now at midnight all the agents\
And the superhuman crew\
Come out and round up everyone\
That knows more than they do\
Then they bring them to the factory\
Where the heart-attack machine\
Is strapped across their shoulders\
And then the kerosene\
Is brought down from the castles\
By insurance men who go\
Check to see that nobody is escaping\
To Desolation Row\
\
Praise be to Nero\'92s Neptune\
The Titanic sails at dawn\
And everybody\'92s shouting\
\'93Which Side Are You On?\'94\
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot\
Fighting in the captain\'92s tower\
While calypso singers laugh at them\
And fishermen hold flowers\
Between the windows of the sea\
Where lovely mermaids flow\
And nobody has to think too much\
About Desolation Row\
\
Yes, I received your letter yesterday\
(About the time the doorknob broke)\
When you asked how I was doing\
Was that some kind of joke?\
All these people that you mention\
Yes, I know them, they\'92re quite lame\
I had to rearrange their faces\
And give them all another name\
Right now I can\'92t read too good\
Don\'92t send me no more letters no\
Not unless you mail them\
From Desolation Row										
\fs24 \cb1 \
\

\fs32 \cb3 They say ev\'92rything can be replaced\
Yet ev\'92ry distance is not near\
So I remember ev\'92ry face\
Of ev\'92ry man who put me here\
I see my light come shining\
From the west unto the east\
Any day now, any day now\
I shall be released\
\
They say ev\'92ry man needs protection\
They say ev\'92ry man must fall\
Yet I swear I see my reflection\
Some place so high above this wall\
I see my light come shining\
From the west unto the east\
Any day now, any day now\
I shall be released\
\
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd\
Is a man who swears he\'92s not to blame\
All day long I hear him shout so loud\
Crying out that he was framed\
I see my light come shining\
From the west unto the east\
Any day now, any day now\
I shall be released										
\fs24 \cb1 \
\

\fs32 \cb3 With your mercury mouth in the missionary times\
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes\
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes\
Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?\
With your pockets well protected at last\
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass\
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass\
Who among them do they think could carry you?\
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\
Should I leave them by your gate\
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\
\
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace\
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace\
And your basement clothes and your hollow face\
Who among them can think he could outguess you?\
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims\
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims\
And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns\
Who among them would try to impress you?\
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\
Should I leave them by your gate\
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\
\
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list\
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss\
And you wouldn\'92t know it would happen like this\
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?\
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug\
And your Spanish manners and your mother\'92s drugs\
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs\
Who among them do you think could resist you?\
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\
Should I leave them by your gate\
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\
\
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide\
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide\
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?\
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?\
They wished you\'92d accepted the blame for the farm\
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm\
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms\
How could they ever, ever persuade you?\
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\
Should I leave them by your gate\
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\
\
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row\
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go\
And your gentleness now, which you just can\'92t help but show\
Who among them do you think would employ you?\
Now you stand with your thief, you\'92re on his parole\
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold\
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul\
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?\
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\
Should I leave them by your gate\
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\
\
Se\'f1or, se\'f1or, do you know where we\'92re headin\'92?\
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?\
Seems like I been down this way before\
Is there any truth in that, se\'f1or?\
\
Se\'f1or, se\'f1or, do you know where she is hidin\'92?\
How long are we gonna be ridin\'92?\
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?\
Will there be any comfort there, se\'f1or?\
\
There\'92s a wicked wind still blowin\'92 on that upper deck\
There\'92s an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck\
There\'92s a marchin\'92 band still playin\'92 in that vacant lot\
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, \'93Forget me not\'94\
\
Se\'f1or, se\'f1or, I can see that painted wagon\
I can smell the tail of the dragon\
Can\'92t stand the suspense anymore\
Can you tell me who to contact here, se\'f1or?\
\
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled\
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field\
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring\
Said, \'93Son, this ain\'92t a dream no more, it\'92s the real thing\'94\
\
Se\'f1or, se\'f1or, you know their hearts is as hard as leather\
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together\
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor\
I\'92m ready when you are, se\'f1or\
\
Se\'f1or, se\'f1or, let\'92s disconnect these cables\
Overturn these tables\
This place don\'92t make sense to me no more\
Can you tell me what we\'92re waiting for, se\'f1or?\
\
Down the street the dogs are barkin\'92\
And the day is a-gettin\'92 dark\
As the night comes in a-fallin\'92\
The dogs\'92ll lose their bark\
An\'92 the silent night will shatter\
From the sounds inside my mind\
For I\'92m one too many mornings\
And a thousand miles behind\
\
From the crossroads of my doorstep\
My eyes they start to fade\
As I turn my head back to the room\
Where my love and I have laid\
An\'92 I gaze back to the street\
The sidewalk and the sign\
And I\'92m one too many mornings\
An\'92 a thousand miles behind\
\
It\'92s a restless hungry feeling\
That don\'92t mean no one no good\
When ev\'92rything I\'92m a-sayin\'92\
You can say it just as good.\
You\'92re right from your side\
I\'92m right from mine\
We\'92re both just one too many mornings\
An\'92 a thousand miles behind

\fs32 \cb3 They sat together in the park\
As the evening sky grew dark\
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones\
\'92Twas then he felt alone and wished that he\'92d gone straight\
And watched out for a simple twist of fate\
\
They walked along by the old canal\
A little confused, I remember well\
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin\'92 bright\
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train\
Moving with a simple twist of fate\
\
A saxophone someplace far off played\
As she was walkin\'92 by the arcade\
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin\'92 up,\
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate\
And forgot about a simple twist of fate\
\
He woke up, the room was bare\
He didn\'92t see her anywhere\
He told himself he didn\'92t care, pushed the window open wide\
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate\
Brought on by a simple twist of fate\
\
He hears the ticking of the clocks\
And walks along with a parrot that talks\
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in\
Maybe she\'92ll pick him out again, how long must he wait\
Once more for a simple twist of fate\
\
People tell me it\'92s a sin\
To know and feel too much within\
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring\
She was born in spring, but I was born too late\
Blame it on a simple twist of fate

\fs32 \cb3 When your mother sends back all your invitations\
And your father to your sister he explains\
That you\'92re tired of yourself and all of your creations\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
\
Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you\
And the smell of their roses does not remain\
And all of your children start to resent you\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
\
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned\
Have died in battle or in vain\
And you\'92re sick of all this repetition\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
\
When all of your advisers heave their plastic\
At your feet to convince you of your pain\
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
\
Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to\
All lay down their bandanas and complain\
And you want somebody you don\'92t have to speak to\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?\
Won\'92t you come see me, Queen Jane?

\fs32 \cb3 My love she speaks like silence\
Without ideals or violence\
She doesn\'92t have to say she\'92s faithful\
Yet she\'92s true, like ice, like fire\
People carry roses\
Make promises by the hours\
My love she laughs like the flowers\
Valentines can\'92t buy her\
\
In the dime stores and bus stations\
People talk of situations\
Read books, repeat quotations\
Draw conclusions on the wall\
Some speak of the future\
My love she speaks softly\
She knows there\'92s no success like failure\
And that failure\'92s no success at all\
\
The cloak and dagger dangles\
Madams light the candles\
In ceremonies of the horsemen\
Even the pawn must hold a grudge\
Statues made of matchsticks\
Crumble into one another\
My love winks, she does not bother\
She knows too much to argue or to judge\
\
The bridge at midnight trembles\
The country doctor rambles\
Bankers\'92 nieces seek perfection\
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring\
The wind howls like a hammer\
The night blows cold and rainy\
My love she\'92s like some raven\
At my window with a broken wing\
\
Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted\
Can\'92t help but wonder what\'92s happenin\'92 to my companions\
Are they lost or are they found\
Have they counted the cost it\'92ll take to bring down\
All their earthly principles they\'92re gonna have to abandon?\
There\'92s a slow, slow train comin\'92 up around the bend\
\
I had a woman down in Alabama\
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic\
She said, \'93Boy, without a doubt\
Have to quit your mess and straighten out\
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic\'94\
There\'92s a slow, slow train comin\'92 up around the bend\
\
All that foreign oil controlling American soil\
Look around you, it\'92s just bound to make you embarrassed\
Sheiks walkin\'92 around like kings\
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings\
Deciding America\'92s future from Amsterdam and to Paris\
And there\'92s a slow, slow train comin\'92 up around the bend\
\
Man\'92s ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don\'92t apply no more\
You can\'92t rely no more to be standin\'92 around waitin'\
In the home of the brave\
Jefferson turnin\'92 over in his grave\
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan\
And there\'92s a slow, slow train comin\'92 up around the bend\
\
Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters\
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition\
But the enemy I see\
Wears a cloak of decency\
All nonbelievers and men stealers talkin\'92 in the name of religion\
And there\'92s a slow, slow train comin\'92 up around the bend\
\
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting\
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it\
They say lose your inhibitions\
Follow your own ambitions\
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it\
There\'92s a slow, slow train comin\'92 up around the bend\
\
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin\'92 boy she could destroy\
A real suicide case, but there was nothin\'92 I could do to stop it\
I don\'92t care about economy\
I don\'92t care about astronomy\
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets\
There\'92s a slow, slow train comin\'92 up around the bend

\fs32 \cb3 There\'92s a long-distance train rolling through the rain\
Tears on the letter I write\
There\'92s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much\
But she\'92s drifting like a satellite\
\
There\'92s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze\
Laughter down on Elizabeth Street\
And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone\
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat\
\
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise\
But he practiced what he preached from the heart\
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me\
The time and the place that the trouble would start\
\
There\'92s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage\
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage\
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page\
Of a book that no one can write\
Oh, where are you tonight?\
\
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure\
To live it you have to explode\
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed\
Sacrifice was the code of the road\
\
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John\
Strong men belittled by doubt\
I couldn\'92t tell her what my private thoughts were\
But she had some way of finding them out\
\
He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same\
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf\
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair\
And discovered her invisible self\
\
There\'92s a lion in the road, there\'92s a demon escaped\
There\'92s a million dreams gone, there\'92s a landscape being raped\
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape\
I won\'92t but then again, maybe I might\
Oh, if I could just find you tonight\
\
I fought with my twin, that enemy within\
\'92Til both of us fell by the way\
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees\
While the law looks the other way\
\
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes\
The guy you were lovin\'92 couldn\'92t stay clean\
It felt outa place, my foot in his face\
But he should-a stayed where his money was green\
\
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit\
With the juice running down my leg\
Then I dealt with your boss, who\'92d never known about loss\
And who always was too proud to beg\
\
There\'92s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room\
And a pathway that leads up to the stars\
If you don\'92t believe there\'92s a price for this sweet paradise\
Remind me to show you the scars\
\
There\'92s a new day at dawn and I\'92ve finally arrived\
If I\'92m there in the morning, baby, you\'92ll know I\'92ve survived\
I can\'92t believe it, I can\'92t believe I\'92m alive\
But without you it just doesn\'92t seem right\
Oh, where are you tonight?

Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile\
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean\
And you\'92re the best thing that he\'92s ever seen\

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile\
Why wait any longer for the world to begin\
You can have your cake and eat it too\
Why wait any longer for the one you love\
When he\'92s standing in front of you\

\cb3 The festival was over, the boys were all plannin\'92 for a fall\
The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin\'92 in the wall\
The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin\'92 wheel shut down\
Anyone with any sense had already left town\
He was standin\'92 in the doorway lookin\'92 like the Jack of Hearts\
\
He moved across the mirrored room, \'93Set it up for everyone,\'94 he said\
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin\'92 before he turned their heads\
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\
\'93Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?\'94\
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\
\
Backstage the girls were playin\'92 five-card stud by the stairs\
Lily had two queens, she was hopin\'92 for a third to match her pair\
Outside the streets were fillin\'92 up, the window was open wide\
A gentle breeze was blowin\'92, you could feel it from inside\
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\
\
Big Jim was no one\'92s fool, he owned the town\'92s only diamond mine\
He made his usual entrance lookin\'92 so dandy and so fine\
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\
\
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\
She slipped in through the side door lookin\'92 like a queen without a crown\
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\
\'93Sorry, darlin\'92, that I\'92m late,\'94 but he didn\'92t seem to hear\
He was starin\'92 into space over at the Jack of Hearts\
\
\'93I know I\'92ve seen that face before,\'94 Big Jim was thinkin\'92 to himself\
\'93Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody\'92s shelf\'94\
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim\
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\
Starin\'92 at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\
\
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she    smiled\
She\'92d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\
But she\'92d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\
\
The hangin\'92 judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\
The drillin\'92 in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\
It was known all around that Lily had Jim\'92s ring\
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\
No, nothin\'92 ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\
\
Rosemary started drinkin\'92 hard and seein\'92 her reflection in the knife\
She was tired of the attention, tired of playin\'92 the role of Big Jim\'92s wife\
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\
Was lookin\'92 to do just one good deed before she died\
She was gazin\'92 to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\
\
Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away\
\'93Has your luck run out?\'94 she laughed at him, \'93Well, I guess you must\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0have known it would someday\
Be careful not to touch the wall, there\'92s a brand-new coat of paint\
I\'92m glad to see you\'92re still alive, you\'92re lookin\'92 like a saint\'94\
Down the hallway footsteps were comin\'92 for the Jack of Hearts\
\
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\
\'93There\'92s something funny going on,\'94 he said, \'93I can just feel it in the air\'94\
He went to get the hangin\'92 judge, but the hangin\'92 judge was drunk\
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\
\
Lily\'92s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch\
She forgot all about the man she couldn\'92t stand who hounded her so much\
\'93I\'92ve missed you so,\'94 she said to him, and he felt she was sincere\
But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear\
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts\
\
No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked\
And Big Jim was standin\'92 there, ya couldn\'92t say surprised\
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin\'92 to the Jack of Hearts\
\
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\
And cleaned out the bank safe, it\'92s said that they got off with quite a haul\
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\
For one more member who had business back in town\
But they couldn\'92t go no further without the Jack of Hearts\
\
The next day was hangin\'92 day, the sky was overcast and black\
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn\'92t even blink\
The hangin\'92 judge was sober, he hadn\'92t had a drink\
The only person on the scene missin\'92 was the Jack of Hearts\
\
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, \'93Closed for repair\'94\
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\
She was thinkin\'92 \'92bout her father, who she very rarely saw\
Thinkin\'92 \'92bout Rosemary and thinkin\'92 about the law\
But most of all she was thinkin\'92 \'92bout the Jack of Hearts

Guess I owe You some kind of apology\
I\'92ve escaped death so many times, I know I\'92m only living\
By the saving grace that\'92s over me\

By this time I\'92d-a thought I would be sleeping\
In a pine box for all eternity\
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping\
For the saving grace that\'92s over me\

Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection\
Wherever I am welcome is where I\'92ll be\
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection\
Is the saving grace that\'92s over me\

Well, the devil\'92s shining light, it can be most blinding\
But to search for love, that ain\'92t no more than vanity\
As I look around this world all that I\'92m finding\
Is the saving grace that\'92s over me\

The wicked know no peace and you just can\'92t fake it\
There\'92s only one road and it leads to Calvary\
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I\'92ll make it\

Just a minute before you touch the door\

Don\'92t fall apart on me tonight\
Yesterday\'92s just a memory\
Tomorrow is never what it\'92s supposed to be\

I ain\'92t too good at conversation, girl\
So you might not know exactly how I feel\
But if I could, I\'92d bring you to the mountaintop, girl\
And build you a house made out of stainless steel\
But it\'92s like I\'92m stuck inside a painting\
That\'92s hanging in the Louvre\
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches\
But I know that I can\'92t move\

Don\'92t fall apart on me tonight\
I just don\'92t think that I could handle it\
Don\'92t fall apart on me tonight\
Yesterday\'92s gone but the past lives on\
Tomorrow\'92s just one step beyond\
And I need you, oh, yeah\
\
Who are these people who are walking towards you?\
Do you know them or will there be a fight?\
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through\
Can they tell you what\'92s wrong from what\'92s right?\
Do you remember St. James Street\
Where you blew Jackie P.\'92s mind?\
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet\
And laid his life on the line\
\
Let\'92s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl\
No more booby traps and bombs\
No more decadence and charm\
No more affection that\'92s misplaced, girl\
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms\
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?\
He looked so baffled and so bewildered\
When he played and we didn\'92t dance\
\
Don\'92t fall apart on me tonight\
I just don\'92t think that I could handle it\
Don\'92t fall apart on me tonight\

But I would not feel so all alone\
Everybody must get stoned\
\
You took a part of me that I really miss\
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this\
You told yourself a lie, that\'92s all right mama I told myself one too\
I\'92m trying to get closer but I\'92m still a million miles from you\
\
You took the silver, you took the gold\
You left me standing out in the cold\
People ask about you, I didn\'92t tell them everything I knew\
Well, I\'92m trying to get closer but I\'92m still a million miles from you\
\
I\'92m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep\
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep\
Did so many things I never did intend to do\
Well, I\'92m tryin\'92 to get closer but I\'92m still a million miles from you\
\
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low\
I need every bit of it for the places that I go\
Sometimes I wonder just what it\'92s all coming to\
Well, I\'92m tryin\'92 to get closer but I\'92m still a million miles from you\
\
Well, I don\'92t dare close my eyes and I don\'92t dare wink\
Maybe in the next life I\'92ll be able to hear myself think\
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don\'92t know who\
Well, I\'92m tryin\'92 to get closer but I\'92m still a million miles from you\
\
The last thing you said before you hit the street\
\'93Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet\'94\
I said, \'93That\'92s all right, you do what you gotta do\'94\
Well, I\'92m tryin\'92 to get closer, I\'92m still a million miles from you\
\
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me \'92til everything gets real\
Rock me for a little while, rock me \'92til there\'92s nothing left to feel\
And I\'92ll rock you too\
I\'92m tryin\'92 to get closer but I\'92m still a million miles from you\
\
Well, there\'92s voices in the night trying to be heard\
I\'92m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word\
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two\
Yes, I\'92m tryin\'92 to get closer but I\'92m still a million miles from you\
The man in me will do nearly any task\
And as for compensation, there\'92s little he would ask\
Take a woman like you\
To get through to the man in me\
\
Storm clouds are raging all around my door\
I think to myself I might not take it anymore\
Take a woman like your kind\
To find the man in me\
\
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling\
Just to know that you are near\
Sets my heart a-reeling\
From my toes up to my ears\
\
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein\'92 seen\
But that\'92s just because he doesn\'92t want to turn into some machine\
Took a woman like you\
To get through to the man in me\
\
Well my heart\'92s in the Highlands, gentle and fair\
Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air\
Bluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow\
Well my heart\'92s in the Highland\
I\'92m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go\
\
Windows were shakin\'92 all night in my dreams\
Everything was exactly the way that it seems\
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page\
Same ol\'92 rat race\
Life in the same ol\'92 cage\
\
I don\'92t want nothing from anyone, ain\'92t that much to take\
Wouldn\'92t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake\
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery\
I wish someone would come\
And push back the clock for me\
\
Well my heart\'92s in the Highlands wherever I roam\
That\'92s where I\'92ll be when I get called home\
The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme\
Well my heart\'92s in the Highlands\
I can only get there one step at a time\
\
I\'92m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound\
Someone\'92s always yelling turn it down\
Feel like I\'92m drifting\
Drifting from scene to scene\
I\'92m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?\
\
Insanity is smashing up against my soul\
You can say I was on anything but a roll\
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top\
What would I do with it anyway\
Maybe take it to the pawn shop\
\
My heart\'92s in the Highlands at the break of dawn\
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan\
Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low\
Well my heart\'92s in the Highlands\
Only place left to go\
\
I\'92m in Boston town, in some restaurant\
I got no idea what I want\
Well, maybe I do but I\'92m just really not sure\
Waitress comes over\
Nobody in the place but me and her\
\
It must be a holiday, there\'92s nobody around\
She studies me closely as I sit down\
She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs\
She says, \'93What\'92ll it be?\'94\
I say, \'93I don\'92t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?\'94\
\
She looks at me, says, \'93I\'92d bring you some\
But we\'92re out of \'92m, you picked the wrong time to come\'94\
Then she says, \'93I know you\'92re an artist, draw a picture of me!\'94\
I say, \'93I would if I could, but\
I don\'92t do sketches from memory\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 she says, \'93I\'92m right here in front of you, or haven\'92t you looked?\'94\
I say, \'93All right, I know, but I don\'92t have my drawing book!\'94\
She gives me a napkin, she says, \'93You can do it on that\'94\
I say, \'93Yes I could, but\
I don\'92t know where my pencil is at!\'94\
\
She pulls one out from behind her ear\
She says, \'93All right now, go ahead, draw me, I\'92m standing right here\'94\
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see\
Well she takes the napkin and throws it back\
And says, \'93That don\'92t look a thing like me!\'94\
\
I said, \'93Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does\'94\
She says, \'93You must be jokin\'92.\'94 I say, \'93I wish I was!\'94\
Then she says, \'93You don\'92t read women authors, do you?\'94\
Least that\'92s what I think I hear her say\
\'93Well,\'94 I say, \'93how would you know and what would it matter anyway?\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 she says, \'93you just don\'92t seem like you do!\'94\
I said, \'93You\'92re way wrong\'94\
She says, \'93Which ones have you read then?\'94 I say, \'93I read Erica Jong!\'94\
She goes away for a minute\
And I slide up out of my chair\
I step outside back to the busy street but nobody\'92s going anywhere\
\
Well my heart\'92s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds\
Way up in the border country, far from the towns\
With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow\
My heart\'92s in the Highlands\
Can\'92t see any other way to go\
\
Every day is the same thing out the door\
Feel further away then ever before\
Some things in life, it gets too late to learn\
Well, I\'92m lost somewhere\
I must have made a few bad turns\
\
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes\
They\'92re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes\
All the young men with their young women looking so good\
Well, I\'92d trade places with any of them\
In a minute, if I could\
\
I\'92m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog\
Talking to myself in a monologue\
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat\
Somebody just asked me\
If I registered to vote\
\
The sun is beginning to shine on me\
But it\'92s not like the sun that used to be\
The party\'92s over and there\'92s less and less to say\
I got new eyes\
Everything looks far away\
\
Well, my heart\'92s in the Highlands at the break of day\
Over the hills and far away\
There\'92s a way to get there and I\'92ll figure it out somehow\
But I\'92m already there in my mind\
And that\'92s good enough for now
